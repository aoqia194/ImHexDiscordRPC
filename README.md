# ImHex Discord RPC

This is a Discord RPC plugin for ImHex. That's all!

## Usage

Put in plugins folder or download it.

## Building

Msbuild not supported. I personally build this with msys2/mingw64. Integrates with vcpkg.
Use the cmake preset provided or build manually if you know what you're doing.
Requires `IMHEX_SDK_PATH` to be set correctly!
Follows standard building process of any ImHex plugin.
